/*
 * the software implementation of SAF application and related storage
 * is determined by a standard OpenSSL configuration file `openssl.cnf`.
 * If no config file is given, the default openssl config file will be
 * used. This means that the SAF API is only a wrapper of the EVP API.
 *
 * The OpenSSL use file-level access control, i.e. private keys are
 * encrypted by passwords, there is no default container-level access
 * control mechnsims such as the Java Keytool for the application-level
 * access control of SAF API.
 *
 * We use the AppHandle to preserve the CONF object.
 *
 * So we dont provide such access control. The Login() will always
 * success. And the ChangePin() has no effects.
