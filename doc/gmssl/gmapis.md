# GM APIs



Every GM API has two header files, takes the SDF API as an example:

 * The standard header file `include/openssl/sdf.h` without any changes.
 * The extended header file `include/openssl/gmsdf.h`. The `gm` version includes the original one with some GmSSL extensions. The users should always use the `gm` version.
